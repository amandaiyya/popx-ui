# 🎨 PopX – UI  

**PopX – UI** is a **React JS application** built to convert a given design into a responsive, pixel-perfect user interface.  
The project is deployed on **Vercel** and demonstrates clean code practices, reusable components, and smooth navigation.  

---

## 🔹 Features
- 🎨 **Pixel-perfect UI** implementation from design specifications (Adobe XD / Figma / custom design)  
- 📱 **Mobile-first design**, with centered layout on larger screens (simulates a mobile app view in the browser)  
- 🔄 **Seamless navigation** between pages using React Router  
- 🧩 **Reusable custom components** such as `Input` and `Button`  
- ⚡ **Form handling & validation** (submit button disabled until all required fields are filled)  
- ❌ **Wildcard routing (404 Page Not Found)** handled gracefully  
- 🚀 **Deployed on Vercel** for fast and reliable hosting

## 🔹 Tech Stack
**Frontend:**
- [React JS](https://react.dev/) – Component-based UI library  
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) – Page navigation  
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – Styling & responsive design  
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) *(optional: for scalable form handling)*  

**Other Tools:**
- GitHub – Version control & repository hosting  
- Vercel – Deployment

## 🔹 Deployment

### The project is live and deployed on Vercel 🚀

👉 Live Demo: https://popx-ui-alpha.vercel.app

👉 GitHub Repo: https://github.com/amandaiyya/popx-ui.git

## 🔹 Notes

- Designed with a mobile-first approach, centered on desktop to look like a mobile app.

- Includes reusable components (Input, Button) to maintain clean and scalable code.

- 404 routes handled with a custom “Not Found” page.

- Authentication pages (login/register) are UI only — no backend integration.

- 📝 For this assignment, I used React state to handle the form since it’s small. In a larger real-world project, I would use React Hook Form for cleaner validation and scalability.
